### ðŸš€ Announcement
screenpipe is raising $5M in February! Talk to founders from Feb 15â€“28.

### ðŸŽ¯ Market Position
screenpipe's exciting journey continues! We've hit the perfect market spot and are experiencing accelerated organic top-funnel growth. We haven't reached product-market fit yet, but we're closer than ever before.

We're still an early-stage company, but users love what we're building. Businesses, developers, and consumers leave enthusiastic feedback on social media, generating millions of impressions:

<blockquote>
I can no doubt see the value in this. Even as a big skeptic of AI, the ability for a computer to pull up details from throughout the day or interject is genuinely a powerful idea.

### ðŸ§  screenpipe: The Missing Context Layer for AI
As foundational AI models become commoditized, context is taking center stage. Every AI agent, app, and model is only as good as the context it receives. That's where screenpipe comes in.

screenpipe runs locally on a user's computer (or on a server for B2B) and captures all screen, system, and audio activity, structuring it into a local database that LLMs access via function calling. This is a critical infrastructure layer powering the entire AI stack. Because it's local and open-source, people trust it. Once data is captured, it can be selectively passed to a local or cloud-based LLM.

screenpipe is a developer-first platformâ€”developers can integrate via the screenpipe API/SDK or build Next.js apps and deploy them directly to the screenpipe marketplace.

### ðŸ‘¥ Who's Using screenpipe?
Our power users so far are engineers using it for personal productivity. They tend to be early adopters of LLM tools and already familiar with AI tools, allowing them to leverage screenpipe across various use cases like meetings, daily summaries, and recallâ€”where screenpipe excels.

### ðŸš€ Popular Use Cases:

#### ðŸ”¹ Instant Recall
This literally happened while preparing this newsletter. We lost a draft but instantly recovered it through screenpipe! The system retrieved a video of the draft from the database, along with the text data.

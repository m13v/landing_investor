# landing_investor
A fork from the [screenpi.pe/investors](https://screenpi.pe/investors) website
![Screenshot of the landing page](./public/screenshot.png)


fundraising is hard, but spending time sending out repetitive information about your round is even harder. we've decided to maintain one place for all investor related information on our website. i hereby include the open source version of it

# getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m13v/landing_investor.git
cd landing_investor
npm install
npm run dev
```


# suggestions

i'm happy to turn this into something more meaningful. request features by creating a github issue

potential features:
- file preview
- locked dataroom
-
